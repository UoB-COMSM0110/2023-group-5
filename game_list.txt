Game Ideas

Justin:
-Text based adventure game (like Candybox)
-Tower defence game (like, Stick Wars, Age of War)
-Strategy game (like Civilization, but simpler)
-Super Mario but with a twist (i.e. varying gravity?)
-Candy crush?
-Angry birds (I like this one, but rotational dynamics are a pain)
-Tank trouble (Might be quite fun to do)
-Space astroid mining while fighting off pirate ships
