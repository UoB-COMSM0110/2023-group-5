Idea Brainstorm:
-Space Invaders but you're the alien (Jon
-Mario?
-RPG - Zelda inspired
-Roguelike - generated content
-Shadow of Mordor - Nemesis system. Enemies adapt to the ways you've defeated them.
-Battle city - It is similar to Tank Trouble
-Adventure puzzle games (like Cube Escape, Isoland, Gorogoa)
-Text based adventure game (like Candybox) (no)
-Tower defence game (like, Stick Wars, Age of War) (maybe)
-Strategy game (like Civilization, but simpler) (maybe)
-Super Mario but with a twist (i.e. varying gravity?) (no)
-Candy crush? (no)
-Angry birds (I like this one, but rotational dynamics are a pain) (no)
-Tank trouble (Might be quite fun to do) (pending)
-Space asteroid mining while fighting off pirate ships (maybe)

Best four:
-Tower defence
-Space asteroid strategy game
-Tank-Trouble
-Raiden (like space defenders)

Short-list Criteria:
-Creativity
-Fun to play
-Technically Impressive
-Ease of coding
-Scope for expansion

Final Two:
-Tower defence
-Space asteroid strategy game
